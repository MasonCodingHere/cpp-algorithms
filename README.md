This repository contains C++ based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

## How to Use

Every directorys under */data-structures* or */algorithms* should be treated as a independent project. For example, the *LinkedList* under data-structures has this structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ clean.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ include
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ LinkedList.h
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ LinkedList.cpp
â””â”€â”€ __test__
    â””â”€â”€ test_LinkedList.cpp
```
