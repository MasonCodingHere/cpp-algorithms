## How to Use

Every directorys under */data-structures* or */algorithms* should be treated as a independent project. For example, the *LinkedList* under data-structures has this structure:

```
.
├── build.sh
├── clean.sh
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── LinkedList.h
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── LinkedList.cpp
└── __test__
    └── test_LinkedList.cpp
```
